üìå Project Overview
Project Title: Sales Trend Analysis (Internship Task 06)
Level: Beginner
Database: PostgreSQL / MySQL / SQLite

This project is part of the Data Analyst Internship (Task 06). It demonstrates core SQL skills for analyzing sales data by calculating and interpreting monthly revenue and order volume. The analysis aims to uncover time-based trends and provide actionable insights for business decision-making.

üéØ Objectives
Database Setup: Create a two-table database schema for customer orders and product details.

Relationship Building: Establish a relationship between the tables using a Foreign Key.

Data Aggregation: Use aggregate functions like SUM() and COUNT(DISTINCT) to calculate key metrics.

Business Analysis: Answer real-world business questions by analyzing sales trends over time.

üóÇÔ∏è Project Structure
1. Database Setup
Two tables are created to hold customer order information and specific order details.

SQL

-- Table to store customer and order date information
CREATE TABLE Customer_Orders (
    "Name" VARCHAR(255),
    "Order ID" INT PRIMARY KEY,
    "Order Date" DATE,
    "Product ID" INT,
    "City" VARCHAR(255),
    "State" VARCHAR(255)
);

-- Table to store product and pricing details for each order
CREATE TABLE Orders (
    "Order ID" INT,
    "Product ID" INT,
    "Product" VARCHAR(255),
    "Product State" VARCHAR(255),
    "Selling Price" FLOAT,
    "Product Cost" FLOAT,
    "Quantity" FLOAT,
    FOREIGN KEY ("Order ID") REFERENCES Customer_Orders("Order ID")
);
üìä Data Analysis & Findings
Overall Sales Trend (Revenue & Volume)

SQL

-- Get a full monthly report of revenue and order volume.
SELECT
    EXTRACT(YEAR FROM co."Order Date") AS sales_year,
    EXTRACT(MONTH FROM co."Order Date") AS sales_month,
    SUM(o."Quantity" * o."Selling Price") AS monthly_revenue,
    COUNT(DISTINCT o."Order ID") AS monthly_order_volume
FROM
    Customer_Orders co
JOIN
    Orders o ON co."Order ID" = o."Order ID"
GROUP BY
    sales_year,
    sales_month
ORDER BY
    sales_year,
    sales_month;
Top 3 Months by Revenue

SQL

-- Get the top 3 months with the highest revenue.
SELECT
    EXTRACT(YEAR FROM co."Order Date") AS sales_year,
    EXTRACT(MONTH FROM co."Order Date") AS sales_month,
    SUM(o."Quantity" * o."Selling Price") AS monthly_revenue
FROM
    Customer_Orders co
JOIN
    Orders o ON co."Order ID" = o."Order ID"
GROUP BY
    sales_year,
    sales_month
ORDER BY
    monthly_revenue DESC -- Sort from highest to lowest revenue
LIMIT 3; -- Get only the top 3 rows
Annual Performance Review (e.g., for 2023)

SQL

-- Get the monthly revenue trend for the year 2023.
SELECT
    EXTRACT(YEAR FROM co."Order Date") AS sales_year,
    EXTRACT(MONTH FROM co."Order Date") AS sales_month,
    SUM(o."Quantity" * o."Selling Price") AS monthly_revenue
FROM
    Customer_Orders co
JOIN
    Orders o ON co."Order ID" = o."Order ID"
WHERE
    EXTRACT(YEAR FROM co."Order Date") = 2023 -- Filter for a specific year
GROUP BY
    sales_year,
    sales_month
ORDER BY
    sales_month;
üîé Findings
Business Health: The analysis provides a clear view of both revenue and order volume, giving a balanced perspective on business activity.

Peak Seasons: Identified the highest-revenue months, which is crucial for planning marketing campaigns and managing inventory.

Performance Tracking: The queries allow for easy year-over-year and month-over-month performance comparisons.

Actionable Insights: The results directly inform strategic decisions, such as allocating more resources during historically slow months or capitalizing on peak periods.

üìë Reports
Overall Sales Summary: A complete report showing monthly revenue and order volume over time.

Top Performance Report: A list of the top-performing months by revenue.

Annual Report: A filtered report showing the sales trend for a specific year.

‚úÖ Conclusion
This project successfully demonstrates a complete SQL analysis pipeline for time-series sales data. It covers database schema design, data aggregation, and the generation of actionable business insights. The queries are designed to be easily adapted for ongoing monitoring and reporting in a real-world retail environment.
